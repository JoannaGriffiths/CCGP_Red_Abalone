# CCGP_Red_Abalone

This repository contains three pipelines with code and tutorials for analyzing whole-genome sequencing data from the California Conservation Genomics Project (CCGP) for the red abalone species. The code is split into three sections:
* VCF filtering and identification and removal of the putative sex-determining region
* Population structure and population genetic analyses
* Outlier analyses, genome-environment associations, and gene ontology characterization and enrichment
